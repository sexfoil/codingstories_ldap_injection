### LDAP Injection Story

In this story we will be provided with a guidance for preventing LDAP injection
flaws in your applications.

An example application (Java 11) authenticates a user based on a login and password.
It's using a simple in-memory LDAP server [InMemoryLdapServer](InMemoryLdapServer.java) .

There are a methods to authentication check and search in the simple service class [SimpleLdapService](SimpleLdapService.jave).
This service uses the simple [LdapClient](LdapClient.java) to connect to the server.
The methods use filters to check and find existing user.

A test class [LdapInjectionTest](LdapInjectionTest.java) contains tests to check both correct user input and user input for injection.
